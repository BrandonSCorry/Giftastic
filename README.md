# Giftastic

## Goal

Using the Giphy API, allow users to search for any gif topic they choose.

Create dynamic buttons from the search textbox input and then display the resulting gifs from Giphy's API when the button is clicked.

Gifs are initially displayed as static until the user clicks the image, toggling on/off the animated state.
